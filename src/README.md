## Usage

The application features a dedicated landing page where users are introduced to its functionalities through a concise overview. Positioned in the top right corner of the header is a login button, which, upon activation, directs users to the login page. Below the introductory paragraph, there is a "Get Started" button that serves the same purpose, guiding users to the login interface upon selection.

To proceed, users are required to input their student ID and password on the login page. The student ID must adhere to a length limitation of eight digits, while the password is restricted to five digits. Notably, the login page exclusively accepts numerical entries for enhanced security.

Upon successful authentication, users are seamlessly redirected to the dashboard page. The left-side navigation bar within the dashboard encompasses sections such as "Dashboard," "Grade Report," "Report Missing Grades," "Contact Instructor," and "Help and Support," providing efficient access to various functionalities.

The dashboard prominently displays the student's current grades and features an alert system for missing grades. Users can toggle this alert by interacting with the notification bell positioned on the top right corner of the page. Additionally, the "Contact Instructor" functionality enables users to access instructor contact details and send emails using the designated "Send Mail" button on the contact instructor page.

For further guidance on utilizing the application, users can explore the "Help and Support" page, which hosts additional information, guides, and support resources.

In summary, the application offers a formal and structured user experience, ensuring ease of navigation and functionality for users engaged in academic activities.
