# What I learnt.
### 1. Enhanced Development Speed with React:
Engaging with React significantly boosted my project's pace by eliminating redundant coding tasks. The framework's component-based structure allowed for streamlined development, reducing the need to repeat code blocks. This not only enhanced efficiency but also contributed to a more maintainable and scalable codebase. The modular nature of React components facilitated code reuse, creating a smoother development experience.


### 2. Improved Bug Identification Across Platforms:
Beyond the confines of the Visual Studio Code platform, React proved invaluable in honing my bug identification skills. While VS Code offers real-time alerts for potential issues, working with React expanded my ability to identify and troubleshoot bugs in diverse environments. This broader perspective on debugging has not only increased the robustness of my projects but has also strengthened my overall proficiency as a developer.
