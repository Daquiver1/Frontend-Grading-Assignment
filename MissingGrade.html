              The computer science course at the University of Ghana is challenging but immensely rewarding. It requires dedication and problem-solving skills. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, from fundamentals to advanced technologies. The department provides strong support and a collaborative learning environment. While it's demanding, the difficulty contributes to a robust skill set. Remember, overcoming challenges is part of the learning process, and your perseverance will lead to success.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Within the first year of your study as a student who wishes to pursue Computer Science, you start of as a student pursing Mathemathical Science which involves the foundational combination of Mathemathics, Economics, Geography, Statistics and all other fundamental courses required in your first year to qualify for Computer Science.

                    Just like people, each lecturer is different but they are generally kind and helpful, a few might be considered strict but they only do so to help.

                <p>
                    We aren't exactly restricted but we do have specific courses we are required to pick from. You can choose to add non weighted courses and sometimes even weighted courses beyond the specified ones but it is not recommended. The course is already challenging and involving.

                <p>
                    Getting computer Science as a major usually means you will have to get excellent grades. Usually a B minimum in all DCIT courses and  C minimum in other courses should grat admission into the course. But it may also change depeding on the years activities and teaching.
