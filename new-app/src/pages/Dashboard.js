        Our school uses a standard grade system. Students are graded on a scale of A to F, with A being the highest grade and F being the lowest. 
        A student's grade is determined by their performance on various assignments, exams, and projects throughout the year.
        Additionally, teachers consider attendance, participation, and classroom behavior when assigning grades. 
        It is important to note that this system may vary slightly depending on the teacher's interpretation of the student's work. 
        Teachers also have the option to assign "+" or "-" grades, indicating above 
       average or below average performance, respectively. Finally, letter grades are converted to 
       numerical grades using a predetermined scale and the overall performance of the student is determined by the C.G.P.A.
