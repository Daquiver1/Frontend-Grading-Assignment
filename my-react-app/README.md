## What I Learnt
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and here are some key points to summarize what can be learned in React.js:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   React is built around the concept of reusable components. Components encapsulate the structure, behavior, and style of UI elements.

2. **Virtual DOM:**
   React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the actual DOM. It calculates the most efficient way to update the UI and applies changes selectively.

3. **JSX (JavaScript XML):**
   JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax similar to XML or HTML within your JavaScript code.

4. **State and Props:**
   React components can have local state managed by `useState` hook and receive data through props. State represents the mutable data within a component, while props are immutable properties passed from a parent component.

5. **Lifecycle Methods (in Class Components):**
   Class components have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. These methods allow you to perform actions at different stages of a component's life.

6. **Functional Components and Hooks:**
   With the introduction of hooks, functional components can now manage state and side effects using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc. This simplifies component logic and reduces the need for class components.

7. **Conditional Rendering:**
   React allows for conditional rendering based on state, props, or other conditions. This enables dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

8. **Routing:**
   React applications often use libraries like React Router for handling navigation and creating a multi-page experience within a single-page application.

9. **Forms and Controlled Components:**
   React provides a controlled component pattern for handling form inputs. State is used to control and manage the values of form elements.

10. **Context API:**
    The Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's particularly useful for sharing global state.

11. **React Hooks:**
    Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They enable better code organization and reusability.

12. **Redux (Optional State Management):**
    For larger applications, Redux can be used for centralized state management. It provides a predictable state container that works well with React.

These are just some of the key concepts in React.js, and the framework is continually evolving. React provides a flexible and efficient way to build scalable and maintainable user interfaces for web applications.
