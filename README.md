# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [Bootstrap].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RgDivine/11342871_DCIT205_Assignment-1.git
cd repo-name11342871_DCIT205_Assignment-1
npm i react-routter-dom
npm install react-boostrap boostrap
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage

Logging In:

Open the application and navigate to the login page.
Enter your credentials, such as username and password, to log in.
Upon successful login, you'll be directed to the dashboard or main page.

Viewing Grades:

On the dashboard or main page, you should find a section displaying your grades.
This section typically includes a list of courses, associated grades, credit hours, and semesters.
Users can view their grades for different semesters and courses.

Reporting Missing Grades:

Look for a dedicated section or form for reporting missing grades. This could be a separate page or a link in the navigation menu.
Fill in the required information, such as the course name, instructor details, expected grade, and an explanation for reporting the missing grade.
Submit the form. Upon submission, the application may provide a confirmation message.

Contacting Instructors:

Navigate to the instructor contact page or find a link to instructor contacts.
You may see a list of instructors along with their contact details, or there could be a form to send messages directly.
Select the instructor you want to contact and use the provided method, such as email or a messaging system within the application.
Provide necessary details, ask questions, or seek clarification on grades or course-related matters.

Additional Functionalities:
