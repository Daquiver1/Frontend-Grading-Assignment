## By Kwesi Ahenkorah Gyamenah, 11116940

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 6 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mazza9/DCIT_205_ASSIGNGMENT1.git
cd 11116940_DCIT205_Assignment1
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

##Usage

The App starts in the homepage. There, you can navigate your way to a button saying "Log In to Check Grades". This button, when clicked, leads you to the login page where after a successful login (i.e. when you enter numbers in as student id and pin and submit the form), you are redirected to your dashboard. The Dashboard shows how you're performing, assignment deadlines and most importantly, it shows if any of your grades is missing. If you happen to have missing grades, you can click on "Missing Grades?" in the header to use a form that allows you to report the issue. You can also access the "Instructor Contact Page" by clicking the "Instructors" link in the header. Here, you find a list of instructors' contact information. The simulated email feature allows seamless communication with instructors to discuss grades or seek clarification on academic matters. You can acces this feature by clicking on any of the instructors' contact information.If you encounter any problems while using the application, you can also click the "Help & Support" link in the header. This leads you to a Help page with FAQs and a contact form to submit inquiries and receive assistance from the system administrators.
