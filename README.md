# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Bootstrap].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/DCIT_205_ASSIGNGMENT1.git
cd repo-name
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage

Describe how to use the application, highlighting key functionalities such as logging in, viewing grades, reporting missing grades, and contacting instructors.

## Insights, Improvements, and Learnings
Developing this project was a valuable learning experience as it was my first experience with the REACT framework.

# Improvements:

1. React and Bootstrap integration: Utilizing React and Bootstrap proved effective in creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. These libraries facilitated building modular and reusable components, simplifying code maintenance and enhancing the overall user experience.
Data fetching and manipulation: Implementing logic for fetching and manipulating data from an API or backend source is crucial for displaying dynamic and accurate grade reports. This project provided practical experience in working with data in React applications.

2. User-centered design: Prioritizing clear information presentation and intuitive navigation helped create a user-friendly interface. Features like the semester selection and grade distribution breakdown enhance user interaction and understanding.

# Challenges:

1. Chart integration: Initially, integrating a JavaScript library for charts encountered some minor challenges. However, troubleshooting and exploring alternative data presentation methods like lists led to a successful solution.

2. Dynamic data handling: Implementing logic for handling data changes based on user interaction, such as selecting a semester, required careful planning and attention to detail. This process provided valuable practice in state management and component lifecycle methods in React.

3. Maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase: As the project progressed, ensuring code clarity and maintainability became crucial. Implementing proper commenting, structuring components effectively, and utilizing appropriate design patterns helped achieve this goal.

# Learnings:

It was an interesting experience overall since I had a lot of bugs to fix.

These taught me about working better with npm and setting up my react app with create-react-app and Vite(even though I later went without it)

The challenges encountered and the lessons learned will be valuable assets for future projects and contribute to my continuous growth as a developer.
