PROJECT OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to create a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It is a simulation of a real-world programme that allows students to examine, report, and control their academic grades. This solution solves the issue of unrecorded or missing grades in a student's profile.

Homepage: Introduction to the system and its purpose.
Login Page: Mock login interface for student authentication.
Dashboard: Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
Grade Report: Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
Missing Grade Form: Enables students to report missing grades.
Instructor Contact Page: Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
Help and Support: Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.
