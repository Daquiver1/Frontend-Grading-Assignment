## Lesson Learned 
Through this tiring task, I managed to navigate the challenges and successfully manipulate the React DOM while utilizing DOM functions. This experience provided me with valuable lessons on interacting with the React DOM and making dynamic changes to the user interface. I learned how to leverage DOM functions like `getElementById`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `setAttribute` to access and modify elements within the DOM tree. Furthermore, I gained insights into updating component state to trigger re-renders and ensure a seamless synchronization between the DOM and React components. Understanding event handling in React was also a key takeaway, enabling me to effectively respond to user interactions. I recognize the importance of adhering to React's best practices and guidelines when manipulating the DOM, as the virtual DOM diffing algorithm plays a vital role in optimizing updates.
