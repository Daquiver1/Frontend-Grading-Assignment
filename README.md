# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kadia-D/11297365_DCIT205_Assignment1.git
cd 11297365_DCIT205_Assignment1
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage

To use this app, users are expected to log in on the login page to start using the app.
After logging in, users can navigate to any of the available pages for various services.

The landing page gives a rough overview of the app, its features, testimonials and how to reach out for support.

So on the contact page, a user can send an email to a lecturer by tapping on the 'send email' button, which opens a text box to allow the user to send their message.

On the Dashboard, there is an overview of all the students grade, and alerts of any missing grades.

Any student with a missing grade can go to the missing grade form, to file a complaint to the lecturer responsible for the course, in order to have their issue rectified.

The grade report page gives all the sstudents grades which they can filter out by year, or view all grades at once.

The help and support page has frequently asked questions in case a user has a question. If their issue is not included in the FAQs, they can fill a form and reach for support from our team.
