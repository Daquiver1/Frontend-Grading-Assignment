# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Muiz Ajeola Bello -- 11068463

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS and Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muizbello/11068463_DCIT205_Assignment1.git
cd 11068463_DCIT205_Assignment1
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage
The application is implemented over the web. Using it is intuitive as there are visible,self explanatory buttons and features that allow the user to manouvre through the various app sections. A user would first have to login using a student ID and pin. The user will then be redirected to the landing page, where they will have the opportunity to visit the other pages through the navbar, or log out. On the grade report page, users are able to view their grades for every semester or academic year depending on the filter selected. In case of any missing grade, the missing grade form allows users to lodge a complain and seek resolution of said problem. Users also have the ability to contact the instructors that handle the courses for which they might suspect errors in their grades.
