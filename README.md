# Experience:
As the developer of this Grading Report Website, I aimed to create a user-friendly and efficient system for both students and instructors. The dashboard provides a quick snapshot of a student's academic performance, while the detailed grade report allows for a more in-depth analysis. The missing grade form ensures that students can easily communicate any discrepancies, fostering transparency in the grading process.

The instructor contact page promotes open communication, allowing students to reach out to their instructors when needed. Additionally, the help and support section provides a resource for frequently asked questions and a simulated support contact form for further assistance.

I hope you find this application helpful in managing and improving the grading process. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
