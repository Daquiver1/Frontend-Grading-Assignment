## About
## " STUDENT REPORT SYSTEM" is a unique digital platform I've designed to enhance student-teacher communication. It provides an organized space where students can track their academic progress in real-time. The website offers features that allow students to view their grades, see any missing assignments, and receive feedback from their instructors. This tool aims to promote responsibility, self-awareness, and proactive behavior among students, empowering them to take charge of their learning journey. It also facilitates teachers in managing and communicating academic progress, making education more transparent and effective.
