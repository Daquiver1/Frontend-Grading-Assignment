# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

- Name: Ryan Brown
- Student ID: 11357610

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details
- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React],[Vite]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid]
- **TypeScript Functionality:** Used for secure forms, dynamic content, and smooth interactions.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally using SSH, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AkweiBrown/11357610_DCIT205_Assignment1.git 
cd 11357610
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Project Insights: A Developer's Journey
### Challenges & Learnings:
Routing & Dependencies: Navigating the intricate dance of routing and interdependent components was a major learning curve. Fixing routing issues sometimes triggered cascading styling changes, requiring meticulous debugging.

Styling Tweaks & Tricky Interactions: Achieving pixel-perfect UI and smooth user interactions involved constant iteration and experimentation. Mastering CSS flexbox and grid layout was key to this success.

TypeScript Magic: Leveraging TypeScript for secure forms, dynamic content, and smooth interactions proved invaluable. It added a layer of confidence and robustness to the application.

Overall, this project was a rewarding exercise in front-end development. It pushed me to explore new technologies, refine my problem-solving skills, and appreciate the power of clean code. I'm excited to see this project evolve and continue to learn as I build more complex web applications.
