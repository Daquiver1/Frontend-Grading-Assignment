- *Missing Grade Form:* Enables students to report missing grades.
- *Instructor Contact Page:* Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- *Help and Support:* Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- *Framework/Technology Used:* [React]
- *Responsive Design:* Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS].
- *JavaScript Functionality:* Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

## Functions of the webpages

### Logging in.

##### User authentication: 
By requiring authentication, only authorized users are able to access their customized accounts. Usually, it requires entering a username and password, but occasionally, for extra security, two-factor authentication is required.
 
##### Personalized Experience:
 After logging in, users have access to their own personal information, including announcements, announcements about the course, assignments, grades, and other pertinent information that is specific to their account.

### Viewing Grades.


##### Progress Tracking:
 Students can keep tabs on their academic standing and performance in specific courses by having access to their grades. Students are able to assess their areas of strength and growth by looking at their grades for assignments, tests, and the entire course.

 ##### Timely Feedback:
 Students receive timely feedback on their work when grades are accessed, which enables them to assess their performance, spot problems, and take the necessary steps to improve.

##### Goal Setting: 
Students are encouraged to strive for better results and academic success by viewing their grades, which gives them the ability to set goals and benchmarks for themselves.

### Missing Grade.

##### Accuracy and Transparency: 
Owing to technical difficulties or errors, grades occasionally may not be recorded or visible. By having the option to report missing grades, students can make sure that all grades are recorded accurately in their academic records and that instructors or administrative staff are informed of any discrepancies.

##### Quick Resolution:
 Students who report missing grades open a line of communication with the appropriate staff, who then look into the matter and take immediate action to fix it. This contributes to keeping student academic records accurate and unbiased.

### Tutors.

##### Communication Channel: 
Students and teachers can communicate easily when they use the application to get in touch with instructors directly. It does away with the requirement for in-person meetings and the reliance on outside channels of communication like phone calls or emails.

##### Help and clarifications:
 Students can contact their instructors for help or clarification on assignments, course materials, or difficult concepts. They can also ask for help or direction with their coursework or seek out suggestions for succeeding academically.

##### Addressing Concerns:
 Students can communicate with instructors about any worries or problems they may be having, including how personal circumstances are affecting their academic performance, how to request an extension, or how to make other arrangements.

 ### Support.

##### Support and Direction:
 To help users navigate and use the application efficiently, support functionality gives them access to resources, documentation, FAQs, or a help center. It assists users in obtaining clarification on certain features or in finding answers to questions.

##### Troubleshooting: 
One feature of support could be the ability to report problems with technology or ask for help from technical experts. If users have any technical issues with the application, they can report bugs, troubleshoot, or get in touch with the support team for assistance.

### Dashboard.

##### Overview and Navigation: 
The application's dashboard acts as a central hub, giving users quick access to the most important features and functionalities as well as an overview of pertinent information. It might show notifications, data summaries, upcoming events, or tailored suggestions.

##### Customization:
 By choosing which widgets or modules to display, users can frequently alter the way their dashboard appears. The information and features that are most important to users can be prioritized by customizing their dashboard.
