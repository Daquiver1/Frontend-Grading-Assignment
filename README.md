# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the student’s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techpepson/DCIT_205_Assign.git
cd DCIT_205_Assign
npm create vite@latest
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage

Describe how to use the application, highlighting key functionalities such as logging in, viewing grades, reporting missing grades, and contacting instructors.

# Home page

The application has a home page which is the default page when opened. From there, users can navigate to all other sites of the page. There is a text that introduces users to the site.

# Login Page

In the Login page, there is a form for users to enter their details so they can be registered on the site.

# Dashboard

The dashboard page shows review of the various actions of users such as reports made, course overview, etc. This page uses grid to make some adjustment to the table.

# Help

In the help page, there are texts that give users some vivid information on how to use the site and make their complaints and other things. I have a bouncing image at the bottom-right corner which when clicked will display a form for users to send our customer support messages for responses.

# Missing Grade

On the missing grade page, I have a form for users to send or make their reports to the lecturers. These reports include reports of missing grade and expected grade among other details. When a report is made, the users entered details will be stored in a table so they can be referenced at any latter time. This data can be cleared by the user at any time as the user wishes.

# Grade Report

In this page, I have a form for users to enter their student details, including course code, id, programme, etc. This is to help get a review of the details of students. To see data, just type in anything into any of the fields and a table will be developed showing all entered data.

# Instructor Page

In the instructor contact page, I have details of lecturers such as the names and emails of lecturers. Just click a lecturer's name to see his or her details, and click on the details to send the lecturer an email message. When the lecturer name is not available in the list, just manually type the details to send message to the lecturer.
