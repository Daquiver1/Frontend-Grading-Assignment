# What I learnt from this project

In my opinion, working on this project has been educative, fun, stressful, time consuming and at times frustrating. The positives I picked from the completion of this project was exposure and development of my knowledge in react, css and javascript.

I had the opportunity to discover to know more about react and also understand how it works. That is with regards to components, routers, hooks, the modules some of which were crucial to the page layout. I was able to combine components also.

For the css aspect, I had gained enough knowledge from the prievious project. But I also studied some new ways of styling and modifying jsx components. 

For the javascript aspect, I came across ways of creating personalized functions and implementing them in react which is not done the normal way.

For the responsive design aspect, I studied ways to create websites that provide optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The goal was to ensure that the system looks and functions well on different devices. I made use of components such as media queries, flexible images and media, viewport meta tag, css flexbox and grid.

The main challenge I encounter while working on this project had to do with Structuring all the components and linking them. This specifically had to do with routing.   Alos using css to attain this responsive design was really stressful and required intensive studies with practical applications.
