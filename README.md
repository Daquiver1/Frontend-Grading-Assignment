## Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details
I used react, css and javascript


## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/DCIT_205_ASSIGNGMENT1.git
cd repo-name
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage

The website consists of seven pages, all of which are routed and so will be rendered individually when each page is requested for without refreshing the whole site.
On the website you can contact instructors, see frequently asked questions and view grades.
