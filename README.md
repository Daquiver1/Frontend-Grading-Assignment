# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile. Students can submit complaints only a number of times in a semester

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React(vite)]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jewtechx/Frontend-Grading-Assignment.git
cd Frontend-Grading-Assignment
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `localhost:5173` at the default port.

## Usage

. The student is first suppose to login with his/her student id and pin that was given on the admission letter. This means there is no option to create an account

. Students can have access to their grades for all the time they have been in the school

. Students can file a complaint for remarking if they are not satisfied with their grades for a specific course

. Students can get access to the contact for all the instructors in their department
