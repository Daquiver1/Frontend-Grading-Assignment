# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend - Kwabena Owusu-Darko (11170189)

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System called GradeRepo. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** A mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** React
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using CSS Flexbox/Grid and Tailwind CSS.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodditor/Frontend-Grading-Assignment.git
cd assignment-1
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port, 3000.

## Usage

The app welcomes you with a hero section indicating its goal and giving you a peek of its interface. The Navbar gives you access to all seven pages in the app, while focusing on a call-to-action to login.

Once on the login page, you can enter your Student ID and Student Pin, but make sure to enter valid inputs, since the client-side form validation enforces the pattern attribute in each input.

Completing the login redirects you to the dashboard, where you have a brief view of all completed and missing grades, with an option to open the 'My Grades' page to have a detailed view of the grades.

The 'My grades' page shows the course ID, title, semester, academic year and grade attained for each course. While also providing details of any grades missing.

The 'Report Grade' page features a form that allows you to report any missing grades, but requires you to input the course details and a reasonable explanation before submission.

The 'Instructors' page features the details of various course instructors, and provides a simple dialog to contact the lecturer with a message without revealing the lecturer's email, which is assumed to be private.

The 'Help' Page features frequently asked questions (AI generated) and a contact form to send a message to the webmaster.
