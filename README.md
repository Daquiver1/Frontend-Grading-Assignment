# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** [React]
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using [CSS Flexbox/Grid, Tailwind CSS].
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doreen09/11210385_DCIT205_ASSIGNMENT
cd repo-name
npm install

```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port.

## Usage
 The system once opened takes the user to the Landing page. The Landing page has all the navigations to the Login, Dashboard, Grade Reports and Help pages. An overview of user's performance can be found on the Dashboard whereas the Grade Reports Page provides a detailed view of courses and respective grades. A link provided on the Grade Reports page provides the user with a Missing Grade Report Form, where the user can make complaints about missing grades.
