## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been written for each component using Jest, ensuring the reliability and stability of the user interface. The tests cover a range of user interactions and component states to validate the functionality of the system. By prioritizing testing, we aim to maintain a high standard of quality and provide a bug-free experience for the end-users.

### Test Coverage

- **Landing Page**: Verifies the presence of system overview and navigation links.
- **Login Page**: Ensures the login form is secure and mock authentication behaves as expected.
- **Dashboard Page**: Checks for the correct display of grades and missing grade alerts.
- **Grade Report Page**: Confirms the functionality of the grade filtering system.
- **Missing Grade Form Page**: Validates form submission and confirmation message display.
- **Instructor Contact Page**: Tests the simulated email feature to ensure proper interaction.
- **Help and Support Page**: Assesses the FAQ section and technical support form.

Each page is accompanied by a corresponding test suite that simulates user behavior and verifies that the components respond correctly to user inputs and actions. The Jest framework provides a robust testing environment that is integral to our development process.
