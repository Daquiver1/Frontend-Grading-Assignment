## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** Mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.


## Setup and Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KTTfx/Frontend-Grading-Assignment
