# Student Grade Reporting System Frontend - Kwabena Owusu-Darko (11170189)

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for a Student Grade Reporting System called GradeRepo. It simulates a real-world application where students can view, report, and manage their academic grades. This system addresses the issue of missing or unrecorded grades in a student's profile.

## Application Structure

The application consists of 7 main pages:

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the system and its purpose.
- **Login Page:** A mock login interface for student authentication.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the studentâ€™s current grades and alerts for missing grades.
- **Grade Report:** Shows a detailed view of the student's grades filtered by semester or academic year.
- **Missing Grade Form:** Enables students to report missing grades.
- **Instructor Contact Page:** Lists instructors' contact information with a simulated email feature.
- **Help and Support:** Provides FAQs and a mock support contact form.

## Technical Details

- **Framework/Technology Used:** React
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented using CSS Flexbox/Grid and Tailwind CSS.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Used for form validations, dynamic content rendering, and simulating interactions.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodditor/Frontend-Grading-Assignment.git
cd assignment-1
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application on `localhost` at the default port, 3000.

## Usage

The app welcomes you with a hero section indicating its goal and giving you a peek of its interface. The Navbar gives you access to all seven pages in the app, while focusing on a call-to-action to login.

Once on the login page, you can enter your Student ID and Student Pin, but make sure to enter valid inputs, since the client-side form validation enforces the pattern attribute in each input.

Completing the login redirects you to the dashboard, where you have a brief view of all completed and missing grades, with an option to open the 'My Grades' page to have a detailed view of the grades.
