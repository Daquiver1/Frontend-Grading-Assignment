6. Once logged in, you will be redirected to the Dashboard page where you can view an overview of your current grades and any missing grade alerts.

7. To view detailed information about your grades, navigate to the Grade Report page. You can filter the grades by semester or academic year.

8. To report a missing grade, go to the Missing Grade Form page and fill in the required fields: course name, instructor name, expected grade, and an explanation for the missing grade. Submit the form to receive a confirmation message.
9. For contacting instructors, visit the Instructor Contact page to find a list of instructors along with their contact details. You can also send a simulated email to the instructor.
